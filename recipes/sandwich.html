    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>“My sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle. I call it the Moist Maker.” — Ross</em></p>
    <p>Guys, this is THE sandwich, made from leftover Thanksgiving food, that’s good enough to cause a nervous breakdown. When Ross’s sandwich is stolen from the museum fridge, it’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back (Ross’s back) after a hard year... and yeah, another failed marriage.</p>
    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 slices bread</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li> 
        <li>1/2 cup cranberry sauce</li>
        <li> 6 ounces roasted turkey, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup stuffing</li>
        <li>2 green leaf lettuce leaves optional</li>
        <li>1/2 cup turkey gravy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread a small amount of mayonnaise onto two slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Dip the remaining slice of bread in gravy and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Build the sandwich however you like, placing the gravy soaked bread in the center.</li>
        <li>Gently push together and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
